                            Painting is a very traditional art method, often considered a fine art. Paintings comes in many forms but all paintings are made by applying wet media to some kind of material. This media could be acrylic or oil paint, watercolour, guache, or other less conventional media. Paintbrushes are most commonly used however artists have made use of creative tools such as their fingers or even using gravity to manipulate the paint. 

                            Painting styles such as realism are achieved through small and careful brushstrokes to create smooth and blended textures that emulate real life. Realism was especially prevalent in history where photography did not exist, and it was up to artists to accurately depict the real world, especially human portraits.

                            Impressionism and Expressionism are more gestural painting methods that make use of messier, more expressive brushstrokes and bright colours to capture the atmosphere or energy of a scene. You may recognise the paintings of Claude Monet as a classic impressionist works, or Edvard Munch’s ‘The Scream’ as a key artwork of the expressionist movement.

                            Sculpture is a broad form of art that refers to art created in 3D space. This could be in real life through the manipulation of traditional materials, or digital through the use of 3D scultping programs like Maya, Blender or ZBrush. <br><br>

                            Traditional sculpture is used for both fine art and functional reasons, from gallery pieces to simple pottery. Digital Sculpture is often valuable for concept development, prototyping and mockups of projects. It’s also the method through which 3D animation and game models are created. <br><br>
                            
                            Sculpture is done mainly through the refinement of a material such as wood, clay, epoxy, metal, stone, glass or marble, as well as adding and combining materials to a base.

                            Printmaking is art that is created through the use of stencils carved or cut as well as ink to create solid impressions of colour on a canvas. This can be done to great effect, taking advantage of negative and positive space, gradients and limited colours to create strong and striking works. <br><br>

                            Printmaking may be done for elaborate detailed pieces, or it might be done from a practical standpoint, as multiple pieces and be reproduced from the same stencil. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Types of printmaking include Lino Printing, where a linoleum sheet is cut and used as a stamp for ink on a material. This may be repeated at multiple stages with varying levels of detail cut out. The result is a finished piece made up of many planes of colour. <br><br>

                            Another type of printmaking is screen printing, where a mesh is used to transfer ink to material, while blocking out negative space using a stencil. This may also be repeated for effect. <br><br>

                            Before the age of digital graphics, many posters and graphic designs were created using screen printing. You may also recognise screen printing in the famous work ‘Campbell’s Soup Cans’ by Andy Warhol.

                            Contemporary graffiti is a type of art consisting of writing or drawings on a public surface. It is can be anything from a simple motto to an elaborate painting. Some graffiti even interacts with the real-world environment in creative ways. While grafitti on unauthorised property is not legal, Art movements like Nu Art Aberdeen embrace street art as a way to incorperate art into the built environment. <br><br>

                            Most commonly, grafitti is made using aerosol paint or ‘spray paint’, as well as stencils. Typical grafitti often features bold colours, abstract imagery and expressive typography, however many styles can apply.

                            While ‘cartoon’ covers many individual styles, the basic principles of cartoons are stylised unrealistic or semi-realistic designs and drawings that exaggerate real life. Cartoons often describe animation, although a cartoon is not exclusively animated. Cartoons are usually used to humorous or lighthearted effect, and as a result you will often see cartons in comic strips, satire, or animated media.

                            Vector art is a form of art usually for the purpose of communication or marketing. Unlike painting or illustration which is done by hand, vector art is created digitally using shapes and lines which are mapped graphically. Vector art is often used for logos, graphic designs, posters, labels, and other miscellaneous things like symbols and clipart. Vector artwork techniques are also sometimes applied to animation, as the shapes can be manually manipulated to emulate movement. As a result it is more efficient to produce than hand-drawn animation.
